== Description ==

Musli is a small, flexible tabs slider for your social media networking cards/profiles/last posts/photos lists and so on. This plugin creates a set of animated tabs attached to the one edge of browser's window (up, bottom, left or right). Musli has no limitations in number of tabs - you can add as many tabs as you need, and place on them (almost) anything you like. 

With built-in presets you can quickly configure most popular social profiles like Facebook LikeBox, Google+ Badge, Twitter timeline. Other than that you can even use all of your WordPress widgets.
